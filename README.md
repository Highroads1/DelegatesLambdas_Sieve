# DelegatesLambdas_Sieve
Integer Checker - Check true/false for input number based on filter type

To Run: Simply run .EXE file

This application will prompt for a type of filter to check integers by.
TRUE/FALSE will be displayed depending on selected filter.

Quit the program to re-enter filter type.

*LEARNING EXPERIENCE: The original project was learning DELEGATE usage. The second go at the project replaced delegates with LAMBDA expressions. Old code has been preserved and commented out for viewing.
